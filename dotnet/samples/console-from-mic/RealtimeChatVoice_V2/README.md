# Description of Changes for Clarity

The original code has been refactored into a more organized and modular structure for improved readability, maintainability, and separation of concerns. Below is a summary of the changes made:

### 1. **Environment Configuration Handling**
- Created a new class `EnvironmentWellKnown` to encapsulate the logic of fetching environment variables. This reduces redundancy and centralizes environment-related logic.
- Defined constants in a separate class `Wellknown` to keep frequently used string values in a single location. This minimizes the chances of typos and makes changes easier.

### 2. **Client Provider Class**
- Extracted the logic for client configuration into a new static class `RealtimeClientProvider`.
  - Provides methods to create configured instances of `RealtimeConversationClient`.
  - This reduces complexity in the main class and provides a cleaner way to manage client creation logic.

### 3. **Main Executor Class**
- Created a new class `RealtimeChatVoiceExecutor_V2` which contains the main execution logic.
- Refactored the execution flow into smaller methods to promote modularity and enhance readability:
  - `Execute` method as the main entry point.
  - `ConfigureSessionAsync` for session configuration.
  - `ConfigureFinishTool` to set up the conversation finish tool.
  - `ProcessSessionUpdatesAsync` to handle updates in an organized way.

### 4. **Update Handling and Modularity**
- Split the handling of session updates into dedicated methods:
  - `HandleSessionStarted`, `HandleSpeechStarted`, `HandleSpeechFinished`, `HandleInputTranscription`, `HandleAudioDelta`, `HandleOutputTranscription`, `HandleItemFinished`, and `HandleError`.
  - This makes each update type easier to understand and maintain, as each handler is responsible for only one type of update.

### 5. **Improved Code Organization**
- Each class is placed in a separate file, following the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and improving overall project structure.
- Static classes are used where appropriate to ensure helper methods and shared configurations are available without needing instance management.

### 6. **Logging and Error Handling**
- Enhanced logging to provide better insight into the process flow.
- Added exception handling to provide fallback behavior for potential failures (e.g., microphone input failure).

### 7. **Code Cleanup**
- Removed redundant comments and excessive inline documentation for more concise code.
- Used meaningful method and variable names to convey purpose, reducing the need for extensive comments.
